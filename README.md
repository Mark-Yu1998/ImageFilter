#ImageFilter

The application is a simple photoshop like image filter. I would be able to offer user to select an image from their files, and apply different filters on it. The users are able to flip the image horizontally and vertically. Filters that are available are Gaussian, Laplacian, Unsharp masking, Edgy. The image is represented as a n x n matrix, transformation could be done by using different weight the manipulate the RGB values of each Pixel object in the image. The user interface is a java graphic user interface.
